The right hand side of the tab contains a graphical visualization of the dataset.

The plot is interactive. The following user interactions are supported:
- scroll to zoom (hold `x` or `y` to fix one axis),
- left click and drag to box zoom (hold `x` or `y` to fix one axis),
- right click and drag to pan (hold `x` or `y` to fix one axis),
- `ctrl` + click to restore.

The graphical visualization is powered by [AlgebraOfGraphics](http://juliaplots.org/AlgebraOfGraphics.jl/stable/)
and [WGLMakie](http://juliaplots.org/WGLMakie.jl/stable/).
