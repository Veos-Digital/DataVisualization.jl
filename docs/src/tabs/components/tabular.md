The right hand side of the tab contains a tabular visualization of the dataset.

The table is interactive. The following user interactions are supported:
- drag to move or resize columns,
- click on a column header to toggle ascending or descending sorting,
- scroll horizontally or vertically to visualize additional rows or columns.

The tabular visualization is powered by [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/).
