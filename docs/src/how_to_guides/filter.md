# Filter

The Filter tab allows you to filter your dataset and verify rapidly the output of the filtering you selected.
Filters are inferred directly from the dataset's columns and the widgets adapt to the data type of each column: checkboxes for discrete values, and ranges for continuous values.

After applying the filters, the updated table allows you to check the correctness of the process at first glance.
